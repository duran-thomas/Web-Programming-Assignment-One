                <h4>Tablets vs Textbooks</h4>
                <img src="Images\tab-text.jpg" height="175" width="200">
                <p style="font-size:12px;">At a glance, it is clear that tablets can pack in more learning materials than textbooks. Most tablets today are manufactured with memories between 8GB and 64GB, which can hold hundreds of thousands of textbooks. Many of these gadgets also come with expanded memory capabilities, which can double their hard disk spaces. This means a single tablet is more than capable for holding all the textbooks a learner needs plus quizzes and homework. With such capabilities, there will be no need for physical space for storing learning materials.<br>
                Cost is one of the outstanding benefits of tablets. Electronic books obviously cost less than their print versions, meaning the same amount of money can be used to buy more textbooks. With billions of dollars being spent on textbooks annually, the cost savings benefits here is obvious. Even though the initial price of a tablet may be prohibitive, they are not that expensive and their prices are continually falling. Moreover, the thousands of textbooks they can hold can be used to offset their costs.<br>
                There is also growing evidence that students learn better with tablets than with textbooks. According to a MOBILEDIA report titled "Kids to Spur Tablet Growth," a study conducted on algebra students showed that those who used tablets scored higher than those who used print textbooks. Tablets are also lighter, can easily be updated and do not age as fast as printed books.</p>

                <h4>Online vs Face-To-Face Classrooms</h4>
                <p style="font-size:12px;">For those who have a little more time in their schedule. Even if you're hoping for a little flexibility, on-campus courses typically offer day and evening schedules so you can coordinate with your daily commitments. One thing you'll need to remember to factor in is where you live and work in proximity to the campus.
                <br>
                A benefit to taking online courses is that they offer flexibility to the student. This is a great option for those who already have a time commitment with family and work. Online classes will mold with your scheduleâ€”log in to your online course at a time that works best for you as opposed to having to attend a lecture at a specific time.
