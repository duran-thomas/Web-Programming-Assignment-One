                <p style="font-size:15px;">In the past decade society has made leaps and bounds towards integrating technology into our everyday lives. With each new leap we are challenged to redefine how we interact with technology and how it redefines our interactions with each other. </p>

                <h4>Postal Mail vs Email</h4>
                <p><font size="2">
                Postal mail is a method use to send and receive physical mails like letters, packages and anything imaginable. The most popular Postal mail carrier are USPS (United State Postal Service), FedEx (Federal Express), UPS (United Parcel Service) and many more. Postal Mails are carry by Airplanes, mail trucks, mail carriers, trains and boats.
                <br>
                Email or electronic mail is a method use to electronically send and receive small files, letters, music and videos almost instantly. Whether it's from your room to your living room or to a city somewhere in Asia. Anything sends using email methods are broken down into small packets and sends out into many different directions toward receiver address. Email can be access through most computers, phones and other smart devices.

                <h4>Car Phones vs Bluetooth Adapters</h4>
                <p><font size="2">
                While bulky cellular phones were invented in the late 1980s, the car phone was the standard for portable telephone communications during the decade. The phone received a better signal because it was hardwired to the car's battery and used signals connected to landline telephone towers. The device came standard on many luxury vehicles, but it could be installed on most vehicles separately typically in the center console.
                <br>
                These days car phones has been replaced with bluetooth adapters that allow users to connect their mobile phone to the car's stereo system wirelessly.

                <h4>One Way Pager vs Two Way Pager</h4>
                <p><font size="2">
                Emergency personnel, doctors and even IT specialists could be seen wearing a one-way pager in the 1980s. A sender calls the telephone number of the page and is then prompted to enter a phone number. The receiver would then need to call the party back to find out about the situation. The limited functionality of the device made it a novelty of the decade, eventually being displaced by cellular phones and two-way pagers in the 1990s, which could receive both phone numbers and short messages.

                <h4>Cell Phones Then vs Cell Phones Now</h4>
                <p><font size="2">
                Many of the early cell phones were considered to be “car phones,” as they were too large and cumbersome to carry around in a pocket or purse. However, in 1983, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x arrived on the market. Though huge by today's standards, it was considered the first truly mobile phone because it was small enough to carry.
                <br>
                The cell phone has changed and developed so rapidly in the past decade that it seems as though almost anything you can imagine is possible for the future. The convergence of all our tech gadgets into one mobile device is still and will continue to advance in future years to come.
